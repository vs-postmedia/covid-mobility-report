				<h1>How the pandemic could change global transit</h1>
				<p class="subhead">The COVID-19 pandemic caused transit ridership to plummet, throwing many operators into financial turmoil. A look at several of the world's largest transit systems show that <span class="blue-01">transit ridership</span> remains depressed, while <span class="red-01">car travel</span> in several cities approaches or excedes pre-pandemic levels. <span class="grey-01">Trips to the workplace</span>, a major driver of both transportation modes, remains far below 2019 levels.</p>

				<ul class="step-list">
					<li class="step" data>
						<p>In four of the cities examined, <span class="red-01">driving</span> has returned or exceeded pre-pandemic levels. With the exception of Moscow, the gap between drivers and those taking <span class="blue-01">public transit</span> is significant, suggesting that transit operators in those cities face hurdles in convincing riders to return.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="step">
						<p>In Mexico City, Madrid and Paris, both <span class="red-01">driving</span> and <span class="blue-01">transit ridership</span> remain below pre-pandemic averages â€“ although driving in Madrid driving has almost recovered. Interestingly, both modes of transportation are recovering at roughly the same rate in Mexico City and Paris.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="step">
						<p>Seoul is an outlier, with <span class="blue-01">transit ridership</span> almost fully recovered while <span class="red-01">driving</span> remains depressed. Additional reporting is needed to better understand this.</p>
